## The Task

In this take-home exercise, weare required to uncover the impact of global economics, political dynamics and COVID-19 on Singapore's bi-lateral trade (i.e.Â Import, Export and Trade Balance) in 2022, by using appropriate analytical visualisation techniques learned in [Lesson 6: It's About Time]{.underline}.

## The Data

For the purpose of this take-home exercise, Merchandise Trade provided by Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS) will be used. The data is available under the sub-section of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market. The study period chosen is between **January 2020 to December 2022**.

## Data Wrangling and Preparation

**Step 1**: The Merchandise Trade by Region/Market dataset is downloaded from this DOS website ([link](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data)).

**Step 2**: Only country level details are retained in 1000 Dollars and region level details (America, Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania) are eliminated as the focus is on countries.

**Step 3**: Next, trade balance data for a country is calculated using the formula ***Trade Balance = Exports - Imports***,for all countries.

**Step 4**: All trade parameters - import, export, and trade balance - for all countries are combined in one MS Excel worksheet from January 2020 to December 2022.

However, to analyze the data, it is better to pivot the time and corresponding trade value columns. We do this using **Tableau**.

**Step 5**: Load the MS Excel file in Tableau.

## Installing the R Packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, readxl, performance, parameters, see, FunnelPlotR, plotly, knitr, crosstalk, DT, ggdist, gganimate, ggpubr, hrbrthemes, ggridges, ggiraph, viridis, patchwork, scales, treemap, testthat, Hmisc, tidyverse, lubridate, ggthemes, gridExtra, CGPfunctions, ggHoriPlot, data.table)
```

## Importing the Dataset

We now import the pivoted dataset for analysis in R.

```{r}
data <- read_csv("data/tradedata.csv")
```
