The objective of this exercise is to critique the age-sex population pyramid by nine planning areas trellis chart of one of our peers and offer enhancements in R Shiny by using visualization analytics and application best practices taught in lecture 1 and lecture 2.

## 1. Original Design

The trellis chart (butterfly bar chart) used for visualization is good for representing the sex distribution by age-groups in different planning areas.

### 1.1. Clarity:

#### 1.1.1. Non-descriptive graph title:

The criteria for selecting the nine planning areas is unclear from the title. Also, the year of population age-sex pyramid analysis is unclear from the title.

#### 1.1.2. No age-band grouping:

Grouping the 5-year age bands into 10-years or any other grouping would make the y-axis clean and more readable for the viewer.

#### 1.1.3. Missing title for age-bands on the y-axis:

The y-axis has no title that mentions that the axis represents age-bands for the population.

#### 1.1.4. No fixed scale:

X-axis labels are missing, making it difficult for the viewer to know the figures for male and female population. Also, the x-axis scale across nine panels is not fixed. This makes comparison of information across nine planning regions challenging for the viewer.

#### 1.1.5. Missing legend:

The legend describing the colour of the bars on the left- and the right-side of the trellis chart is missing. The viewer thus has to assume that the pink bars represent female population and the blue bars represent the male population.

#### 1.1.6. No data source information:

Including the data source information enhances the credibility of the trellis chart figures.

### 1.2. Aesthetics:

#### 1.2.1. Charts in different sheets:

The trellis chart for each of the nine regions have been created in nine different sheets and then paneled together in the Tableau dashboard. This results in creation of y-axis nine times, reducing the dashboard white space for expanding the trellis charts.

#### 1.2.2. Missing bar labels:

Having labels for the bars enhances the readability for the viewer. Hence, including labels can be good practice, especially when there are many bars in the trellis charts.

#### 1.2.3. Enhanced age axis:

Currently, the labels for the age axis are generic (i.e. they are same as provided by the data source) and not enhanced for aesthetics. Editing the axis labels for better readability can beautify the trellis chart.

#### 1.2.4. Non-supportive grid lines:

As population labels are missing on the x-axis, the grid lines in the trellis charts are redundant as they provide not supportive information.

## 2. Proposed Design

### 2.1. The sketch:

### 2.2. Getting started:

#### 2.2.1. Installing the necessary packages:

To start using ggplot, ggplot2, and tidyverse packages for analysis and visualization, we first install the packages in R Studio.

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org", lib = "C:/R-4.2.2")
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org", lib = "C:/R-4.2.2")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

#### 2.2.2. Importing the data:

```{r}
Population_data <- read_csv("data/TH02_AgeSexPop.csv")
```

### 2.3. Data wrangling:

### 2.4. Final outcome:

## 3. The learning

Evaluating my peer's visualization task, helped me learn by putting myself in the viewer's shoes. Small design enhancements can improve the clarity and the beauty of the charts and make the chart more informative. This exercise also helped me strengthen my skills in R by using the packages such as **ggplot**, **ggplot2**, and **tidyverse**. Learning these packages is imperative for me as these packages can help me become an efficient and an effective data analyzer and visualizer.
