Click on this link for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter downloading the data, the requisite worksheets were cleaned and organized for analysis. All ‘Planning Area’ sections by ‘Age’ were combined. The process was applied to both ‘Population of Males by Age Groups and Planning Areas’ and ‘Population of Females by Age Groups and Planning Areas’ MS Excel worksheets.\n\n\n\n\nFor better analysis in Tableau, it is preferable to have data organized as long and lean rather than short and wide. Hence, the short and wide data structure in MS Excel worksheets were opened in Tableau, and all the five-year age bands were pivoted for long and lean data structure. This process is done individually for ‘Population of Males by Age Groups and Planning Areas’ and ‘Population of Females by Age Groups and Planning Areas’.\nThe MS Excel worksheet is first loaded to Tableau.\n\nNext, all five-year age bands are selected and pivoted to transform the data structure.\n\nUsing ‘View Data’ option, the long and lean data – for both males and females – is downloaded as CSV files.\n\n\nThe column names retained in each MS Excel worksheets post pivoting were ‘Planning Area’, ‘Subzone’, ‘Age’ (for five-year age bands), ‘Gender’ (Male or Female, depending on the data worksheet), and ‘Population’ (representing the corresponding population count)."

The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) of Singapore suggests that the area is set to grow in terms of businesses and vibrancy by accommodating a wider diversity of uses, job offerings, and business opportunities for the future economy.1\nGiven the outlook provided by URA, it would be interesting to analyze the current population spread in the Central Area. For this purpose, we look at the proportion of females and males by age groups in the nine most populous planning areas in the Central Area - Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Downtown Core, Newton, Novena, Orchard, Outram, River Valley, and Rochor."

See below the detailed note on the age-buckets –\n\nYoung Dependents – Aged 0 to 14, enrolled in schools, and primarily dependent on their parents. Average spread of female young dependents is 14.3% and that of male young dependents is 14.6% across nine planning areas.\nYoung Work(ing) Group – Aged 15 to 29. The younger folks may have some side income while the older folks have completed their degrees and national service and joined the corporate sector. Average spread of female young work group is 15.6% and that of male young dependents is 13.8% across nine planning areas.\nPrime Work(ing) Group – Aged 30 to 49, mostly married individuals that are now primary providers of the family and have the spirit to grow in their career. Average spread of female prime work group is 33.9% and that of male young dependents is 33% across nine planning areas.\nMature Work(ing) Group – Aged 50 to 69, mostly married individuals, have significant job or business experience and are seeking stability. Average spread of female young work group is 26.6% and that of male young dependents is 29.3% across nine planning areas.\nElderly – Aged 70 and above, mostly retired, maybe partially dependent on primary providers.

Nevertheless, we do see small differences in the distribution for some of the age groups. Few of them to note are –\nKey Finding 01 -\nWhile the average proportion of Young Dependents is around 14% for both females and males across nine regions, this proportion is only 8% and 7%, respectively, in Downtown Core area. This can likely be attributed to higher presence younger workers2, DINK (double income no kids) families, unmarried individuals, and expatriates residing without families in this area.\nKey Finding 02 -\nThe proportion of Prime Work Group was lowest in Bukit Timah - 29% for both males and females. This may be attributed to relatively lower presence of businesses in this area compared to other eight planning areas and high rental property rates.\nKey Finding 03 -\nDowntown Core, Outram, and Rochor had comparatively higher proportion of female and male elderly population residing in these areas – around 12% to 15%. This can be attributed to highest number of residents being employed in these areas, especially from the elderly group.3"
