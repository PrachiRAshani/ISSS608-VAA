This can likely be attributed to higher presence younger workers2, DINK (double income no kids) families, unmarried individuals, and expatriates residing without families in this area.\nKey Finding 02 -\nThe proportion of Prime Work Group was lowest in Bukit Timah - 29% for both males and females. This may be attributed to relatively lower presence of businesses in this area compared to other eight planning areas and high rental property rates.\nKey Finding 03 -\nDowntown Core, Outram, and Rochor had comparatively higher proportion of female and male elderly population residing in these areas – around 12% to 15%.

Original Design\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trellis chart (butterfly bar chart) used for visualization is good for representing the sex distribution by age-groups in different planning areas.\n\n1.1. Clarity:\n\n1.1.1. Non-descriptive graph title:\nThe criteria for selecting the nine planning areas is unclear from the title. Also, the year of population age-sex pyramid analysis is unclear from the title.\n\n\n1.1.2. No age-band grouping:\nGrouping the 5-year age bands into 10-years or any other grouping would make the y-axis clean and more readable for the viewer.\n\n\n1.1.3. Missing title for age-bands on the y-axis:\nThe y-axis has no title that mentions that the axis represents age-bands for the population.\n\n\n1.1.4. No fixed scale:\nX-axis labels are missing, making it difficult for the viewer to know the figures for male and female population. Also, the x-axis scale across nine panels is not fixed. This makes comparison of information across nine planning regions challenging for the viewer.\n\n\n1.1.5. Missing legend:\nThe legend describing the colour of the bars on the left- and the right-side of the trellis chart is missing. The viewer thus has to assume that the pink bars represent female population and the blue bars represent the male population.\n\n\n1.1.6. No data source information:\nIncluding the data source information enhances the credibility of the trellis chart figures.\n\n\n\n1.2. Aesthetics:\n\n1.2.1. Charts in different sheets:\nThe trellis chart for each of the nine regions have been created in nine different sheets and then paneled together in the Tableau dashboard. This results in creation of y-axis nine times, reducing the dashboard white space for expanding the trellis charts.\n\n\n1.2.2. Missing bar labels:\nHaving labels for the bars enhances the readability for the viewer. Hence, including labels can be good practice, especially when there are many bars in the trellis charts.\n\n\n1.2.3. Enhanced age axis:\nCurrently, the labels for the age axis are generic (i.e. they are same as provided by the data source) and not enhanced for aesthetics. Editing the axis labels for better readability can beautify the trellis chart.\n\n\n1.2.4. Non-supportive grid lines:\nAs population labels are missing on the x-axis, the grid lines in the trellis charts are redundant as they provide not supportive information."

This helps to create a clean, condensed yet informational chart that is comparatively easier, than the detailed chart, for the viewer to comprehend.\n\nPopulation_data$Age_groups <- with(Population_data, \n                                   dplyr::case_when(`Age Group` %in% c(\"0 - 4\", \"5 - 9\") ~ '0 - 9',\n                                               `Age Group` %in% c(\"10 - 14\", \"15 - 19\") ~ '10 - 19',\n                                               `Age Group` %in% c(\"20 - 24\", \"25 - 29\") ~ '20 - 29',\n                                               `Age Group` %in% c(\"30 - 34\", \"35 - 39\") ~ '30 - 39',\n                                               `Age Group` %in% c(\"40 - 44\", \"45 - 49\") ~ '40 - 49',\n                                               `Age Group` %in% c(\"50 - 54\", \"55 - 59\") ~ '50 - 59',\n                                               `Age Group` %in% c(\"60 - 64\", \"65 - 69\") ~ '60 - 69',\n                                               `Age Group` %in% c(\"70 - 74\", \"75 - 79\") ~ '70 - 79',\n                                               `Age Group` %in% c(\"80 - 84\", \"85 & Over\") ~ '80+'))\n\nStep 2 - Selecting the planning areas\nAs per the problem statement, we need to select nine planning areas of Singapore and present the age-sex population pyramid for the user. For this exercise, we select the top nine most populous planning areas of Singapore in 2022.\nStep 3 - Creating a data subset\nBased on the chosen nine planning areas, we create a subset from the main dataset. Such a subset makes it easy to further wrangle and visualize the data using ggplot2 and tidyverse.\n\ndata_PA <- Population_data %>%\n  group_by(`Planning Area`) %>%\n  summarise(sum_pop = sum(Population), .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  arrange(sum_pop,.by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  top_n(9)\n\nSelecting by sum_pop\n\ndata_PA\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 2\n  `Planning Area` sum_pop\n  <chr>             <dbl>\n1 Choa Chu Kang    174430\n2 Ang Mo Kio       174920\n3 Yishun           202060\n4 Sengkang         206730\n5 Hougang          222450\n6 Woodlands        250270\n7 Tampines         261300\n8 Jurong West      272810\n9 Bedok            289850\n\n\n\ndata_top9 <- Population_data %>% filter(`Planning Area` %in% c(\"Choa Chu Kang\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Yishun\", \"Sengkang\", \"Hougang\", \"Woodlands\", \"Tampines\", \"Jurong West\",\"Bedok\"))\n\nstr(data_top9)\n\nspc_tbl_ [324 × 6] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Sex           : chr [1:324] \"Female\" \"Female\" \"Female\" \"Female\" ...\n $ Planning Area : chr [1:324] \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" ...\n $ Age Group     : chr [1:324] \"0 - 4\" \"5 - 9\" \"10 - 14\" \"15 - 19\" ...\n $ Population    : num [1:324] 3310 3790 4100 4600 5180 5810 6450 6890 7100 6670 ...\n $ Pop_Proportion: chr [1:324] \"3.65%\" \"4.18%\" \"4.52%\" \"5.07%\" ...\n $ Age_groups    : chr [1:324] \"0 - 9\" \"0 - 9\" \"10 - 19\" \"10 - 19\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   Sex = col_character(),\n  ..   `Planning Area` = col_character(),\n  ..   `Age Group` = col_character(),\n  ..   Population = col_double(),\n  ..   Pop_Proportion = col_character()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=<externalptr> \n\n\n\n\n2.4. Final outcome:\nWe use ggplot2 attributes to visualize the data and modify them to meet our sketch design. This helps us to create enhanced version of the initial design.\n\ndata_top9 <- data_top9 %>% mutate(tooltip_text = paste0(\"Population actuals \", data_top9$Population, \"\\n\", \"Population Proportion \", data_top9$Pop_Proportion))\n\npp <- ggplot(data = data_top9, aes(x = Age_groups, y = Population, fill = Sex, )) +\n  \n  geom_bar(data = data_top9 %>% filter(Sex == \"Male\"),\n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"identity\") +\n\n#, aes(tooltip = tooltip_text, data_id = Age_groups)) \n                            \n  \n  geom_bar(data = data_top9 %>% filter(Sex == \"Female\"),\n           stat = \"identity\",\n           position = \"identity\",\n           mapping = aes(y = -(Population))) +\n  \n  \n  labs (x = \"Age Group\", y = \"Population in 000s\",  title = str_wrap(\"Age-Sex Pyramid of the 9 most populous planning areas in Singapore, June 2022\", width = 90), caption = \"Source: Department of Statistics, Singapore (SingStat)\") + \n\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-15000,15000,3000), labels = c(\"15\", \"12\", \"09\", \"06\", \"03\", \"0\", \"03\", \"06\", \"09\", \"12\", \"15\"))+\n  \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"coral3\", \"darkslateblue\"))+\n\n  coord_flip() +\n\n  theme_minimal () +\n\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Georgia\"),\n    \n        plot.margin = margin(t=1, r=1, b=1, l=1),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = 'bold', hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = 'italic'),\n        plot.caption.position = 'plot',\n        \n        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = 'grey', linewidth = 0.3, linetype = \"dashed\"),\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        \n        axis.line = element_line(color = 'grey'),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 1.03),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 6),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_line(color = 'grey'),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_line('grey'),\n        \n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6)) +\n  \n  # creating a facet wrap for each region\n  facet_wrap(~`Planning Area`, ncol = 3) \n\npp\n\n\n\n#pp2 <- girafe(ggobj = pp)\n#if(interactive()) print(pp2)"

Small design enhancements can improve the clarity and the beauty of the charts and make the chart more informative. This exercise also helped me strengthen my skills in R by using the packages such as ggplot2 and tidyverse. Learning these packages is imperative for me as these packages can help me become an efficient and an effective data analyzer and visualizer."
